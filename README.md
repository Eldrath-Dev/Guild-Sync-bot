## Overview

Wayhaven Enforcer is a comprehensive Discord moderation bot designed to provide cross-server punishment synchronization with integrated ZERO-LEAK security measures.

### Core Functionality
- **Cross-Server Moderation**: Synchronize punishments across multiple Discord servers automatically
- **ZERO-LEAK Security**: Advanced security model preventing unauthorized cross-server actions
- **Comprehensive Audit Logging**: Complete transparency and compliance tracking
- **Professional Moderation Tools**: Ban, mute, kick, timeout, and warning commands
- **GDPR Compliance**: Built-in data protection and privacy management

### Architecture
The bot operates on a hierarchical security model:
- **Main Server (Authority Hub)**: Designated server capable of broadcasting punishments network-wide
- **Child Servers (Execution Nodes)**: Connected servers that receive and apply punishments
- **Immutable Relationships**: Once-way data flow prevents bidirectional command execution

## How to Use

**Critical Setup Order**: For Wayhaven Enforcer to work perfectly and smoothly, you MUST set up your servers in this exact sequence:

### Step 1: Set Up Main Guild (Authority Hub) First
```
Execute in your primary server: /setup main-guild
```
**Why this comes first**: This designates your main server as the authority hub. Without this, no punishment synchronization can occur. The main guild becomes the "principal's office" that can broadcast punishments to connected servers.

### Step 2: Configure Main Guild Settings
After setting up the main guild, configure essential settings:
```
/config muterole role:@Muted
/config notifications channel:#moderation-logs enabled:true
/config logchannel channel:#security-alerts
/config audit enabled:true
```

### Step 3: Connect Child Guilds (Execution Nodes)
After main guild is fully configured, connect additional servers:
```
/setup add-child guild-id:123456789012345678
```
**Important**: Replace `guild-id` with the actual 18-digit Discord server ID of each child server.

### Step 4: Verify Network Synchronization
Check that everything is connected properly:
```
/setup dashboard
```
This command shows your server network status and confirms synchronization is working.

### Step 5: Test Punishment Synchronization
Test that punishments spread correctly:
- Issue a mute command in the main guild
- Verify it automatically applies to connected child servers
- Check audit logs to confirm proper synchronization

### Essential Setup Rules for Perfect Operation
1. **Main guild setup must complete first** - No synchronization works without it
2. **Bot must be invited to ALL servers** - Missing bot invitation = failed sync
3. **Matching mute role names** - Ensure all servers have the configured mute role
4. **Proper permissions** - Bot needs specific Discord permissions in each server
5. **Network test before use** - Always verify with `/setup dashboard` before relying on sync

**Troubleshooting Note**: If punishments aren't syncing, 90% of the time it's because the main guild wasn't set up first, or child guilds weren't properly connected. Re-check the setup sequence above.

## Security Implementation Details

### ZERO-LEAK Security Model

The ZERO-LEAK security framework employs several architectural safeguards:

#### Authorization Layers
1. **Guild Authority Verification**: Every cross-server operation validates the source server's authority level
2. **Relationship Authentication**: Commands verify established trust relationships between servers
3. **Action Scope Enforcement**: Only permitted actions execute based on configured server roles
4. **Audit Trail Integration**: All security decisions are logged with full context

#### Immutable Security Constraints
- **One-Way Propagation**: Punishments flow only from main servers to authorized child servers
- **Relationship Immutability**: Trust relationships cannot be modified during active operations
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Commands require specific permission levels for execution
- **Transaction Atomicity**: Security operations either complete entirely or fail completely

#### Threat Mitigation
- **Injection Prevention**: All inputs sanitized to prevent SQL injection attacks
- **Rate Limiting**: API calls throttled to prevent abuse and system overload
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive configuration data encrypted at rest using industry standards
- **Anomaly Detection**: Unusual patterns flagged for administrative review

### Authority Hierarchy Implementation

#### Main Server (Authority Hub) Capabilities
- **Broadcast Authority**: Can initiate network-wide punishment operations
- **Network Governance**: Manages child server connections and trust relationships
- **Audit Oversight**: Maintains centralized logging of all network activities
- **Security Coordination**: Implements and enforces network security policies

#### Child Server (Execution Node) Capabilities
- **Local Autonomy**: Retains full control over internal server moderation
- **Punishment Reception**: Automatically applies punishments from authorized main servers
- **Notification Forwarding**: Receives and displays punishment notifications
- **Compliance Integration**: Aligns with network-wide moderation policies

---

## Operational Procedures

### First-Time Bot Startup

Execute the bot initialization sequence:

```bash
# Launch the Discord bot application
python bot.py
```

**Successful Initialization Indicators:**
- Database connection establishes successfully
- Bot authentication with Discord API completes
- Command synchronization with Discord servers finishes
- Background services (reconciliation, sync processor) start
- Network connection to all configured servers verified

**Initialization Sequence:**
1. Environment configuration loading and validation
2. Database connectivity test and security constraint verification
3. Discord API authentication and client initialization
4. Command registry synchronization with Discord services
5. Event listener system activation and background task startup

### Network Synchronization Process

#### Punishment Propagation Workflow

1. **Event Detection**: Bot identifies punishment command execution in main server
2. **Authority Validation**: Verifies source server possesses broadcast permission
3. **Relationship Verification**: Confirms target servers have established trust relationships
4. **Permission Assessment**: Validates specific action against configured allowances
5. **Execution Queue**: Adds approved punishment to synchronized processing queue
6. **Parallel Distribution**: Simultaneously applies punishment across authorized servers
7. **Notification Generation**: Sends audit notifications to designated channels
8. **Result Aggregation**: Compiles execution results and reports status

#### Synchronization States

- **Authorized**: Punishment propagates successfully to all permitted servers
- **Partial Success**: Punishment applies to some servers, fails on others (detailed in audit logs)
- **Blocked**: Security validation fails, operation cancelled with full audit trail
- **Queued**: Operation postponed due to rate limiting or system load

---

## Problem Resolution Guide

### Startup Failure Analysis

#### Common Initialization Errors

**Configuration File Issues:**
- **Missing `.env` file**: Create file with required authentication parameters
- **Invalid token format**: Regenerate bot token from Discord Developer Portal
- **Permission insufficient**: Verify bot has required Discord permissions
- **Server ID incorrect**: Confirm server IDs are 18-digit numeric values

**Dependency Problems:**
- **Missing Python modules**: Execute `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Version incompatibility**: Ensure Python 3.8+ and compatible library versions
- **Import path errors**: Verify file locations and PYTHONPATH settings

**Database Connectivity:**
- **File permissions**: Ensure write access to database directory
- **Corrupted schema**: Reinitialize with `python setup_database.py`
- **Version mismatch**: Clear database and perform fresh initialization

#### Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Validate Python environment
python --version
python -c "import sys; print('Python path:', sys.executable)"

# Test core dependencies
python -c "import discord, aiosqlite, dotenv; print('Libraries loaded successfully')"

# Check Discord connectivity
python -c "
import discord
intents = discord.Intents.default()
client = discord.Client(intents=intents)
@client.event
async def on_ready():
    print(f'Connected as {client.user}')
    await client.close()
client.run('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN', log_level=None)
"

# Validate database integrity
python -c "
import aiosqlite
import asyncio
async def check_db():
    async with aiosqlite.connect('wayhaven_enforcer.db') as db:
        cursor = await db.cursor()
        await cursor.execute('PRAGMA integrity_check')
        result = await cursor.fetchone()
        print(f'Database integrity: {result[0]}')
asyncio.run(check_db())
"
```

### Network Synchronization Issues

#### Punishment Propagation Problems

**Connection Validation:**

- Check for any active security alerts impacting operations

#### Synchronization Monitoring

Identify potential issues through systematic verification:

```bash
# Check recent synchronization activities
python -c "
import aiosqlite
import asyncio
async def monitor_sync():
    async with aiosqlite.connect('wayhaven_enforcer.db') as db:
        cursor = await db.cursor()
        await cursor.execute('''
            SELECT COUNT(*) as total_punishments,
                   COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'success' THEN 1 END) as successful,
                   COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'failed' THEN 1 END) as failed
            FROM command_audit
            WHERE created_at > datetime('now', '-1 hour')
        ''')
        results = await cursor.fetchone()
        print(f'Sync Statistics (last hour): Total: {results[0]}, Successful: {results[1]}, Failed: {results[2]}')
